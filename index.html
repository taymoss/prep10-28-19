    <h1> Data Scientist </h1>   
    <p1>A data scientist is someone who takes data and transform to make it easier and more accessible to use. In this case they make the data that would be normally difficult to read and make it more presentable so that it becomes functional for users and businesses. </p1>
    <h1>Computer Scientist and Data Scientist</h1>
    <h2>Similarities</h2>
    <p1> Both recquire some coding. Whether this is coding to get the data scraped off of the source, or simply code to present the data. They have many of overlapping skills because they are so closely related. </p1>
    <h2>Differences</h2>
    <p1> Data science seems to use more math than computer science, being that it is more algorithmetic based. Data science seems to work more with the business than computer science as well because they make the tables and reproduce the data so they can use them again. </p1>
